            Welcome to my database of stuff! <br><br>
               This blog was created as a way for me to store all my recipes that I have tested or created that turned out successful. Along the way, I thought it might be also nice to write about my knitting projects to keep a log about them. <br><br>
                My hope is that this little space will probably expand as I get more comfortable with web development as well! <br><br>
            Please feel free to poke around and try out a few of the recipes or drop me a note to say hi! I'd love to hear from you!
